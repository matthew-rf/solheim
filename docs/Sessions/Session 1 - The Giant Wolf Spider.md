## Summary

### Arrival at Fonsmyth

The party arrived in [[Fonsmyth]] and were immediately greeted by [[Officer Galldin]] at the east gate of the city. After a brief questioning from the stern guard, they began to explore the city and prepare for the adventures to come. [[Giselle Gewelle|Giselle]], [[Isaiah Kasel|Isaiah]], and [[Roxanna Vertium|Roxanna]] started by visiting [[Elhani|Elhani's Brewery]], where they purchased a small batch of healing potions and asked her about the local church beside her shop. Elhani explained that the church isn't open for service most days, but that they could meet with her friend [[Shinji]] at Fonsmyth Square if they wanted to learn more.

After visiting the Church and discovering it was closed, the three met up with [[Cloggard Targaryen|Cloggard]] at the square, where they purchased meat dumplings and bread from local vendors. It turned out that Shinji was the baker they purchased the bread from, and he explained that the church is devoted to [[Adenine, Goddess of Wind]], and that it only opens once a week.

Following their shopping trip, the party booked a two-night stay at [[Pippi|Pippi's Inn]] and proceeded to the local tavern. The tavernkeep, a cheerful elf named [[Sandra]], noticed the harp on Roxanna's back and invited her to perform for the locals that night. Roxanna accepted in exchange for two rounds of free drinks for her party.

During the evening, Galldin entered the tavern in search of the group and immediately invited himself to their table. He explained that the town has been short on manpower lately, and that he was in need of some adventurers to go out and save a junior officer named [[Officer Reyn|Reyn]] that was kidnapped by a Giant Wolf Spider while on a mission. The party accepted, and Galldin advised them to head north into the woods once morning hit. After an evening of music and drinking, they settled into their inn for the night to rest in preparation for their new quest.
### Heading into the forest

At 6:00am sharp, the party met with Galldin again at the east gate, who re-iterated their mission and wished them well. The party travelled without incident for about an hour before being ambushed by a trio of goblins; they sustained some mild injuries, but successfully defeated two of them and scared the third one off. 

Following their scrap with the goblins, the party found themselves at a junction that lead north and east. Straying from their main path, they headed east where they found the entrance to some small ruins. As Cloggard was about to enter, he was ambushed by a single Skeleton from around the corner; however, the party dispatched of the skeleton easily and headed into the ruin.
### The Elmer incident

Upon entering the ruins, Cloggard immediately noticed a neatly-stacked pile of equipment beside the entrance and gleefully picked it up. Utilizing their darkvision, the party continued to venture into the ruins until they turned a corner and found a human hunched over a large chest. Roxanna cautiously approached him and called out, which spurred the man to turn around in surprise.

The party immediately began debating whether he was trustworthy or not, and what they should do with him. Noting the tension, the man prepared to grab the spear from his back and asked what the group was doing. He eventually introduced himself as [[Wandering Elmer|Elmer]], and explained that he was only here to collect items to sell back in town. The party eventually decided that they were interested in the large pack that Elmer carried with him, and drew their weapons for battle.

They were successful in knocking Elmer unconscious, though a well-placed crossbow bolt to the chest incapacitated Isaiah for the duration of the fight. After healing their comrade and gathering whatever they could off of Elmer's unconscious body, the party left the ruins and headed back to the main path. Before leaving, Roxanna left him a loaf of bread as an apology.

### Bandit Ambush

Continuing north, the forest grew thicker and the party grew tired. After taking a short rest to recover, they eventually came across a group of travelling merchants that were being assaulted by bandits. The party came to their rescue, defeating the bandits and looting what they could off their bodies. As thanks, the merchants gave them a strange reward; a sprig of a strange purple plant that they had never seen before.

### A strange acolyte

The party continued into the thickest part of the forest, where the path became harder to navigate and where they were met with several obstacles. To overcome a large swath of sharp pines and logs in front of them, Cloggard picked up each party member and threw them over before leaping over the logs himself.

As soon as they passed the logs, they found a small temple tended to by an old dark elf, [[Acolyte Niall]]. While the drow initially seemed uninterested in speaking to them, he recognized the symbol on Isaiah's robes - a mark of the [[Vanadis, Goddess of Death|Goddess of Death]] - and, after sharing a few words with Isaiah personally, invited the party to rest at his temple.

Niall offered to burn an incense that could rejuvenate the party if they could provide him with a sprig of Vileweed. Remembering the plant they had been rewarded with earlier, the party gave it to him and restored all of their energy before proceeding. Niall shared some sinister words with Isaiah before departing, but Isaiah seemed to pay it little mind.

### The Giant Wolf Spider

Soon, the party found a glade deep in the forest, where Reyn's unconscious body was on the ground. He was covered in a thick spider silk, which Roxanna successfully freed him from.

As soon as Reyn was cut free, the Giant Wolf Spider descended from the trees and attacked the group. Using careful tactics, such as relying on Giselle's Eldritch Blast magic while being supported by Isaiah, the group successfully killed the spider and its small minions without much trouble. Upon the spider's defeat, the party opted to cut open the spider's abdomen to retrieve an egg sac, and cut it's head off to bring home as a trophy.

Roxanna offered to carry Reyn's body home. While they had a close call when traversing the logs from earlier, they successfully made it back without any major incident and without injuring Reyn further. When they arrived back in Fonsmyth, Galldin thanked them for their efforts and rewarded them with 50gp and two free nights at the inn.

Before settling in for the night, Cloggard sold most of his loot to [[Andre the Blacksmith]] for a disappointing price. Giselle also attempted to force the Church of Adenine's door open with her crowbar out of sheer spite, but failed to break through the hefty barricades. After their evening romps, they returned to Pippi's Inn and slept for the night.
