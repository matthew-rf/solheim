**Acolyte Niall** is an NPC first encountered in [[Session 1 - The Giant Wolf Spider]]. He is a cold and anti-social drow that lives a solitary life in a small temple in the Carian woods.
## History

The party passed Elmer's temple when on the way to hunt the Giant Wolf Spider in [[Session 1 - The Giant Wolf Spider|Session 1]]. While they initially disregarded each other, Niall invited the party to rest at his temple after noticing the symbol of [[Vanadis, Goddess of Death|Vanadis]] on [[Isaiah Kasel|Isaiah's]] robe. He burned a special incense to rejuvenate the party as a sign of hospitality before they departed.
