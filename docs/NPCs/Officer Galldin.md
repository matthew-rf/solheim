**Officer Galldin** is an NPC first encountered in [[Session 1 - The Giant Wolf Spider]]. He is a stern and imposing soldier who usually works as a gatekeeper in [[Fonsmyth]].
## History

Galldin was the first NPC to meet the party, as he questioned their entrance into Fonsmyth when they arrived. While he seemed slightly curious about them during their first meeting, Galldin let them through without much incident.

Later that evening, he found them at the [[Sandra|Hearthome Tavern]] and offered them their first quest. He explained that the military was currently lacking in manpower to fulfil all their jobs, so he needed a group of adventurers to complete a task for him. He sent the group into the northern woods to find [[Officer Reyn]], a novice soldier who was kidnapped by a Giant Wolf Spider during a mission. The party accepted Galldin's quest and successfully saved Reyn, impressing Galldin and causing him to take note of their capabilities.
