**Wandering Elmer** is an NPC first encountered in [[Session 1 - The Giant Wolf Spider]]. He is a treasure hunter and vagabond who explores various locations around [[Caria]] in search of things to sell.
## History

The party first encountered Elmer as he was rummaging through a treasure chest in some small, decrepit ruins while exploring the forests north of [[Fonsmyth]]. After a brief and tense introduction, the party drew their weapons on him and initiated a fight with the intention of stealing the large pack Elmer had strapped around his back. Elmer successfully knocked [[Isaiah Kasel|Isaiah]] unconscious with a crossbow bolt shot to the chest, but he ultimately lost the fight and was knocked unconscious by the party. After healing Isaiah's wounds and taking his equipment and money, the party left him in the ruins. [[Roxanna Vertium|Roxanna]] left a loaf of bread beside him as a parting gift.
